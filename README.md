# Review Project: Interaction Design

Review the web design process, HTML, and CSS by planning, designing and building a new program homepage for Interaction Design at George Brown - from the perspective of a student.

For this project, imagine you are attempting to get a job upon graduation. What things would you want an employer to know about this program and why your experiences in this program have readied you for your new career.

- Remember that you have limited time to impress a prospective employer, so ensure that your site uses information architecture and modern design principals to build a webpage that easy to consume without spending hours on site

To help gather information, the college's course info/homepage can be found here:

- [https://www.georgebrown.ca/programs/interaction-design-and-development-program-g103/](https://www.georgebrown.ca/programs/interaction-design-and-development-program-g103/)

**Goal**: Create a 1-page website with clean/modern design that conveys the content using semantic HTML and well written CSS
